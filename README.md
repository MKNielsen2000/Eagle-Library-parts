# Eagle Library parts
Parts library for Eagle CAD that I couldn't find anywhere else. Use at your own risk but feel free to use it for anything you like. And let me know if something doesn't look right, ok? ԅ(≖‿≖ԅ)

I also recommend using these brillant libraries:
* [Tsyklon Labs Library](http://tsyklon.com/diyresource/tsyklon-labs.lbr)
* [Music Thing Modular library](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/MTM-Parts-Library/blob/master/MusicThingModular.lbr)
* [Pattern Agents Touch Library](http://www.patternagents.com/news/2013/11/24/eagle-touch-widgets-library.html)

And this tutorial on how to make parts is great: https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/110
